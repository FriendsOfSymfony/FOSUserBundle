should the quotes be removed, or should the string be wrapped in single quotes ? It looks to me that these quotes are meant to be part of the message

You have to remove the quotes. In other languages (e.g. [turkish](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle/blob/master/Resources/translations/FOSUserBundle.tr.yml#L62)) there are also no double quotes at the beginning.
