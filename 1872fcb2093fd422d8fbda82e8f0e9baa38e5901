Can you please restart Travis jobs?

```
  [Composer\Downloader\TransportException]
  Could not authenticate against github.com
```

I don't understand, I specified `--no-interaction ` option.

@stof I made the needed modifications.

On job [#60436789](https://travis-ci.org/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle/jobs/60436789), I got the following error:

```
 [RuntimeException]
  Could not scan for classes inside "/home/travis/build/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSU
  serBundle/vendor/propel/propel1/runtime/lib" which does not appear to be a
  file nor a folder
```

Don't know why, any idea?

@stof done. Ready for merge. :+1:

Another error:

```
[Composer\Downloader\TransportException]
  Could not authenticate against github.com
```

But `--no-interaction` option is specified.

Composer should fallback to the source install before failing when it cannot authenticate against github.com to avoid the rate limiting.
I think the issue here is that you also cache the ``vendor`` folder, and so there is already an installed package from dist and so it only accepts another dist when updating. I suggest to cache only the composer cache, not the vendor folder.

Yes I agree. Having this kind of issue on my projects too.
