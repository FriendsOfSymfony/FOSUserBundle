@stloyd

> `methods` is missing.

Methods were not defined on the config before this PR. What methods should I add? Can you please precise it on each comment?

Thanks.

I think the following failed Travis job is not related to my PR: https://travis-ci.org/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle/jobs/60293836

Can you restart it?

@Soullivaneuh I'm ok with closing my PR in favor of this one, since it's the easiest way to get the tests you made and the config changes both of us made.

I think the appropriate methods for the four routes mentioned by @stloyd are GET and POST as each of them is rendering a form on GET and handling the submission on POST.

@stloyd routes definition updated following @xelaris suggestions.

It's OK for you?

@stloyd missing methods on security routes are fixed.
